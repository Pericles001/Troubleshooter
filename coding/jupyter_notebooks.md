This error occurs because Jupyter Server 7 has compatibility issues with certain versions of the `notebook` module, leading to missing components.

---

## Solution

To resolve this issue, downgrade the `notebook` module to version 6.5, which is compatible with Jupyter Server 7.

Run the following command:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -U notebook==6.5
\`\`\`

- **`-U`**: Ensures that `notebook` is upgraded or downgraded to the specified version if needed.
- **`notebook==6.5`**: Specifies version 6.5 of the `notebook` package, which includes the `notebookapp` module required by Jupyter Server 7.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Check Installation**: After running the command, restart Jupyter Server to confirm that the error is resolved.
- **Compatibility**: If you rely on other tools or extensions for Jupyter, verify that they are compatible with `notebook` version 6.5.
- **Alternative Solution**: Consider installing JupyterLab as an alternative interface, which may not encounter the same compatibility issues.

By installing the compatible version of the `notebook` module, you should be able to avoid module errors in Jupyter Server version 7.
